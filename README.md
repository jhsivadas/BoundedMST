# BoundedMST
Minimum Spanning Tree Approximation Solution to the NP-Hard Bounded MST problem.

There are 4 different algorithms to approximate a bounded MST problem. Solution 1 uses a Linear Program, solution 2 is simply kruskal's (will approximate properly for certain trees), solution 3 and 4 are modified algorithms for prims that gaurantee a spanning tree but do not optimize for weights.
